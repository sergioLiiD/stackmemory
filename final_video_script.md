## 🎬 Section 1: The Origin Story (The "Why")

**Time**: 0:00 - 0:30
**Visual Style**: Face-to-camera OR clean b-roll of a developer struggling with notes/Obsidian.

| Time | Visual | Script (Voiceover) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00** | Use a personal shot or a shot of scattered notebooks/Obsidian graph. | "I've been developing for over a year and a half now, building project after project. But I kept bumping into the same exhausting issue." |
| **0:10** | Showing a messy desktop, closing tabs. | "How I documented my work always left me wondering. I had notes, links, and disparate docs scattered everywhere... but no comprehensive way to save the *context* of what I was building." |
| **0:20** | Show title: **The Gap** | "I tried tools like Obsidian, Notion... they're great generic tools, but they don't *understand* code. That frustration is exactly why I built StackMemory." |

## 🎬 Section 2: The Hook (/promo Animation)

**Time**: 0:30 - 1:00 (30 Seconds)
**Visual Style**: The `/promo` page animation (Screen Recording).

| Time | Visual Stage | Script (Voiceover/Text) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:30** | **INTRO Phase** <br> "Context is Lost" text. | "We all face it. We build. We deploy... and then we forget." |
| **0:36** | **CHAOS Phase** <br> Particles exploding. | "Context disappears into the void. Documentation gets lost. Links break." |
| **0:42** | **ORDER Phase** <br> Grid forming. | "But what if your code could remember itself? Bringing order to the chaos." |
| **0:48** | **SEARCH Phase** <br> Typing query. | "Meet **StackMemory**. The intelligent layer that connects every file, every dependency..." |
| **0:55** | **FINISHED Phase** <br> Logo Reveal. | "...and gives you a permanent Second Brain. Let me show you how it works." |

| **1:10** | **Project Overview** <br> Click into a project. Highlight **Metadata** & **Secrets**. | "Inside a project, it’s a Command Center. We track your **Data Metadata** and **Secrets** automatically—telling you *which* keys are set without exposing them." |
