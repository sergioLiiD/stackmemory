# Features of StackMemory

This document outlines the current feature set of the StackMemory application.

## Core Core Product

**StackMemory** is an intelligent coding assistant dashboard that helps developers manage their projects, stack, and context.

### 1. Dashboard & Project Management

The central hub for all user activity.

- **Floating Dock Navigation**: Modern, Mac-like dock for quick access to tools.
- **Project Overview**: High-level stats on project health and status.
- **Todo List**: Integrated task management for each project.
- **Journal**: A built-in dev-diary with mood tracking and daily results.
- **Onboarding Flow**: Guided experience for new projects (Vibecoding onboarding).
- **Tour & Onboarding Protocol**: AI-generated "Getting Started" guides tailored to the codebase, including prerequisites and installation steps.
- **Project Insights**: "Deep Dive" reports generating Executive Summaries, Architecture Maps, and Tech Stack analysis.

### 2. Intelligent Stack Analysis

- **Auto-Detection**: Scans `package.json` to automatically identify the tech stack (Frontend, Backend, AI, Database, DevOps).
- **Security Insights**: Real-time vulnerability checking against OSV/NPM (cached for 1h). Highlights outdated dependencies and potential security vulnerabilities dynamically.
- **Upgrade Plan Generator**: AI-driven suggestions for upgrading dependencies.

### 3. AI & Automation

- **GitHub Crawler**:
  - Fetches repository content via GitHub API.
  - Processes files and extracts metadata (language, size).
  - Stores code embeddings for semantic search.
- **Vector Search**: Semantic search capability to find relevant code snippets and context.
- **Context/Assistant**: AI Chat interface with context-awareness of the project codebase.
- **Multimodal Analysis**:
  - Integration with **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** for advanced reasoning.
  - **Video & Image Analysis**: Upload screenshots or screen recordings of bugs/UI for the AI to analyze and debug.
  - Full context awareness of both code and visual inputs.
- **Automatic Semantic Tagging**: AI-driven analysis of journal entries to suggest relevant tags and categorize content.
  - **Magic Button**: Located in the "New Entry" modal.
  - **Workflow**: User types a journal entry -> Clicks "✨ Auto-Tag" -> Gemini analyzes the text context -> Dynamically inserts relevant tags (e.g., #architecture, #bugfix) into the tag field.
- [x] **Prompt Vault**: "Stack" your favorite prompts for easy reuse and management.
- **Context Bridges (MCP Manager)**:
  - **Bridge Locker**: Manage your Model Context Protocol servers directly from the dashboard.
  - **AI Advisor**: Automatically suggests valid MCPs based on your project's technology stack (e.g., suggests `Postgres MCP` if you use Supabase).
  - **Configuration Hub**: Copy-paste ready configs for Claude Desktop or Cursor.
- **n8n Workflow Brain**:
  - **Credential Memory**: Upload your n8n workflow JSONs. StackMemory parses them to detect which API credentials are required (e.g., Stripe, OpenAI) and alerts you if they are missing from your project secrets.
  - **Infrastructure Detection**: Auto-detects dependencies like Postgres or Redis based on workflow nodes.
- **Insight Reports**: Deep-dive analysis of the codebase generated by AI.

### 4. Developer Tools

- **The Trojan Horse CLI**: A powerful command-line interface that silently integrates into your workflow. (`npm install -g stackmemory`)
  - **Authentication**: securely login via `stackmem login` using your dashboard access token.
  - **Project Linking**: Link any local folder to a Vault project with `stackmem init`.
  - **Silent Sync**: `stackmem sync` analyzes your `package.json` to instantly update your Tech Stack and Scripts in the Vault, with Real-time UI updates.
  - **Doctor**: `stackmem doctor` verifies your local environment, token status, and project connection.
  - **Direct Inquiry**: Ask questions to your project's brain directly from terminal with `stackmem ask "how do I..."`.
  - **Journaling**: Log thoughts and decisions without leaving your IDE using `stackmem log "content" -t tag`.
- **Design System Explorer**: Visual overview of the UI components used in the project.
- **Firebase Integration**: Manage and view Firebase project details.
- **Theme Support**: Fully responsive Light and Dark mode (Mac-like aesthetics).
- **Compliance**: Built-in Cookie Consent banner and GDPR-ready policy pages.

## Backend & Infrastructure

### 5. Authentication & User Management

- **Supabase Auth**: Secure authentication via GitHub OAuth and Magic Links.
- **Role-Based Access**: Support for Admin and Standard user roles.
- **User Profiles**: Profile management with avatar and stats.

### 6. Billing & Monetization

- **LemonSqueezy Integration**: Complete checkout flow for premium features.
- **Plan Management**: Handling of different subscription tiers (Free vs Pro).

### 7. Data & Storage

- **Supabase Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data.
- **Supabase Storage**: Buckets for managing file uploads (e.g., project assets).
- **Pgvector**: Vector database extension for AI embeddings.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **AI**: Google Gemini (via embeddings and chat)
